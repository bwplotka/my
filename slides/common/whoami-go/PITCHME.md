Note:

My name is Bartek Plotka, I am an engineer working at Red Hat in the Monitoring team, I love open source and solving problems
especially those involving distributed system problems and using Go.
I am part of Prometheus Team and I am a co-author of Thanos project, which is a durable system for scaling Prometheus. I also love
open source as you can see, because most of the things listed here are written in Go.

I am also active in the CNCF space in newly created Observability Special Interest Group, please join us. On top of that I also run some of the software we develop actively
on production on high scale, which is actually pretty amazing feedback loop.
 
I can really recommend that model: mix of SWD and a bit of devops as it really triggers very solid development
decisions and priority on what matters in our even open source projects.
