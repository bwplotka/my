Note:

My name is Bartek Plotka, I am an engineer working at Red Hat in the Monitoring team, I love open source and solving problems
especially those involving distributed system problems and using Go.
I am part of Prometheus Team and I am a co-author of Thanos project, which is a durable system for scaling Prometheus. I also love
open source as you can see, and really most of the things listed here are written in Go.

I am also active in the CNCF space in newly created Observability Special Interest Group, please join us if you are interested in 
Cloud Native Observability topics! On top of that I also run some of the software we develop actively on production on high scale, which is amazing actually feedback loop. I can really recommend that model SWD + a bit of devops it
really triggers very solid development decisions and priority on what matters in our even open source projects.
