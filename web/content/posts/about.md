Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bartek (full name is BartÅ‚omiej). I originate from Poland, precisely from the city called [GdaÅ„sk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XHPjAUp8Qc), but nowadays, I live and work in London, UK.

I am a curious and (bit too) ambitious human who happened to dive very deeply into software engineering waters. My first dev job started in 2012, and since then, I have enjoyed delivering challenging projects, together with *many* awesome people I met on the way.

My main focus was always building and running software in web/backend/distributed systems/infrastructure areas. Even though I have ongoing experience as a global-scale SRE, I love development the most: I love building pragmatic, innovative, scalable, high-quality solutions.

I worked at [Improbable](https://improbable.io), a fantastic gaming UK startup with a global Kubernetes infrastructure using and developing impressive and unique systems. In late 2017, we created [Thanos](https://thanos.io) project with Fabian Reinartz, which gained popularity as a default choice for scaling Prometheus. That started my shift to work entirely on open source around the Prometheus ecosystem, becoming a Prometheus maintainer and working as Principal Engineer at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com). ðŸš€

In 2022 I published my [Efficient Go](/book) which spawned out of the need to teach others the pragmatic efficiency skills I learned in my career. I hope this will trigger even better quality (and cheaper to run) Go projects in the future! (:

I love innovating, mentoring, teaching, speaking at conferences and working with communities, especially around Observability. That's why at some point, we created
the [CNCF Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for Observability](https://github.com/cncf/sig-observability), where I am performing a technical leadership role.

> I also try to mentor others a few times a year and motivate others to mentor in the [CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring) programs. So if you would like to be a mentor and help to grow the next generation of open source engineers, let me know!
> I am incredibly grateful to those who helped me to be where I am. Thus IMO, we all need to give back sometimes.

The rest of my time is reserved for my beloved wife & family, gym, ~volleyball~ (ACL+MCL injury) and sometimes not-eco-friendly cars (:

### Feedback

I am always looking forward to hearing feedback! (:

Especially if you feel angry with what I say or do, I would love to hear that. This way, we all learn! Reach me through any channels listed on [main page](/).

### CV

Let's just reuse stuff, shall we? (: My is CV is available on Linkedin: [linkedin.com/in/bwplotka/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bwplotka/)

### Open Source

I love innovation in SWE space. This is why you see me creating, but also maintaining various projects. Some of them I created or co-created, some of them I joined afterwards. Not exhausting lists are provided below.
