Hi! 

My name is Bartek (full: Bartłomiej) and I am from Poland and precisely from the city called [Gdańsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XHPjAUp8Qc).

I am some curious and (bit too) ambitious human that happened to dive very deep into software engineering waters.
My first dev job started in 2012 and since then I enjoy delivering *many* challenging projects with *many* awesome people I met on my way.

My main focus was always building and running software in web/backend/distributed systems/infrastructure areas. 
Even though I have on-going experience as a global-scale SRE I love development the most: I love building pragmatic, scalable, high quality solutions.

I might have lots of (maybe) unique opinions about engineering I will love to blog/share about like:

* Define your infra in code. Not in terraform/yaml/jsonnet. (:
* Why true programmer should be language agnostic. 
* Use proper tool for a job. However golang is proper for most of those. ;>
* ...

I am always looking forward to hearing feedback (: I you feel angry that what I say is totally wrong, I would love to hear that. This way we all learn (:

Currently I live London and I am really grateful to work on daily basis with the best engineers in the world in both [Improbable](https://improbable.io) and during my open source
work in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) ecosystem. 

Recently, with Fabian Reinartz, we created [Thanos](https://thanos.io) project, which got some popularity as the default choice for scaling Prometheus. That's why most
of the content of my talks and blog posts are about Thanos.

Rest of my time is reserved by my beloved wife & family, volleyball and sometimes cars (:
