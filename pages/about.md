Hi! 

My name is Bartek (full: Bartłomiej) and I am from Poland and precisely from the city called [Gdańsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XHPjAUp8Qc).

I am some curious and (bit too) ambitious human that happened to dive very deep into software engineering waters.
My first dev job started in 2012 and since then I enjoy delivering *many* challenging projects with *many* awesome people I met on my way.

My main focus was always building and running software in web/backend/distributed systems/infrastructure areas. 
Even though I have on-going experience as a global-scale SRE I love development the most: I love building pragmatic, scalable, high quality solutions.

I am always looking forward to hearing feedback (: If you feel angry that what I say is totally wrong, I would love to hear that. This way we all learn (:

I used to work at [Improbable](https://improbable.io): Amazing Gaming UK Startup. With global scale Kubernetes infrastructure,
we were using and developing technically impressive unique systems. At some point, a couple of years ago, with Fabian Reinartz,
we created [Thanos](https://thanos.io) project, which got some popularity as a kind of default choice for scaling Prometheus. 
That started a shift to work fully on open source around the Prometheus ecosystem.

Currently, I live in London and I am really grateful to work on a daily basis with one of the best engineers in the world
in both [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) and during my open source work in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) ecosystem. 

Rest of my time is reserved by my beloved wife & family, volleyball and sometimes cars (:
